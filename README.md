# sqlalchemy-challenge
In this challenge, we are analyzing climate data in Honolulu, Hawaii to properly plan a long holiday vacation.  We have been given a SQLite file as a resource to help us complete our analysis.
> Checklist:
  - Analyzing and Exploring Climate Data: Used provided files to complete basic analysis and data exploration.
      - Used SQLAlchemy functions(create_engine, automap_base) to load database into Jupyter Notebook file.
          - Saved references to classes and then performed queries to extract the data we were looking for.
      - Created plots of our queried data.
  - Designing Climate App: Designed Flask API based on the prior developed queries.
      - Imported all necessary dependencies.
      - Created f-strings with proper link designation to jsonified data we have queried.
      - Defined objects (via @app.route) with proper terminology to created jsonified lists and dictionaries of our queries.
